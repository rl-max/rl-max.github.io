Hi there, my name is Haeone Lee. My goal is to develop intelligence that is helpful to human, consisting of any forms e.g., physical embodiment(robots), software(android agent). I believe in the power of **Reinforcement Learning**, in that sense (1) it gives the optimal performance (2) it interacts with and adapts to the changing world (3) it is the closest to how animals ‚Äòemerge‚Äô the intelligence as part of goal pursuit. To this end, I am interested in the applications of RL in the robots, [text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05584), [video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04782), and [image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10913) 'world'. To make RL efficient, I deem there are plenty of works to do such as utilizing large offline priors, building abstract decision-making processes, and empowering the algorithms to have enough memorizing capability, deal with long-horizon, and work autonomously. For details, [**this**](https://rl-max.github.io/assets/pdf/Creating_Artificial_Intelligence_from_the_World.pdf) briefly surveys my thoughts.
