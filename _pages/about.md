Hi there, my name is Haeone Lee. I am interested in creating a real-world embodied agent with great physical capability. I believe in the power of **RL**, in that sense (1) it gives the optimal performance (2) it 'emerges' intelligence in the most autonomous way (3) it is the closest to how animals learn. Aside from the real world, I am also interested in the applications of RL in the [text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05584), [video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04782), and [image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10913) 'world'. To realize this goal, I deem there are plenty of works to do such as utilizing large offline priors, building abstract decision-making processes, and empowering RL algorithms to have enough memorizing capability, deal with long-horizon, and work autonomously. For details, [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EVna0yvlGfjYbyOSXRiubBcdI_LojjNKwcPj-mTqc9E/edit?usp=sharing) briefly surveys my thoughts.
