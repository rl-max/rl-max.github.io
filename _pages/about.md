<!-- Hi there, my name is Haeone Lee. My goal is to develop intelligence that is helpful to humans, consisting of any form e.g., physical embodiment(robots), or software(android agent). I believe in the power of **Reinforcement Learning**, in that sense (1) it can reach the optimal performance (2) it interacts with and adapts to the changing world (3) it is the closest to how animals ‚Äòemerge‚Äô the intelligence as part of goal pursuit. To make RL successful, I deem there are plenty of challenges to solve such as enabling efficient exploration, long-horizon control, and safe and autonomous learning. To this end, I am interested in utilizing prior knowledge(e.g., common sense, offline data), and equipping the algorithms with long-term memorizing, hierarchical decision-making, and good abstraction capabilities. For details, [**this**](https://rl-max.github.io/assets/pdf/Creating_Artificial_Intelligence_from_the_World.pdf) briefly surveys my thoughts. 

Hi there, my name is Haeone Lee. My goal is to develop intelligent agent that can outperform human, while also being helpful. I believe in the power of **Reinforcement Learning**, in that sense (1) it can autonomously come up with the solution given only the goal (2) it interacts with and adapts to the changing world (3) it is the closest to how animals ‚Äòemerge‚Äô the intelligence as part of goal pursuit. To make RL successful, I deem there are plenty of challenges to solve such as enabling efficient exploration, long-horizon control, and safe and autonomous learning.

I am interested in building an intelligent agent that can self-improve to be useful for humans, especially in the real world using physical embodiment(e.g., robots). It should generate useful problems and solve them by leveraging prior knowledge with critics to validate the success. Note that I also have the emphasis on the capability of ‚Äúgenerating problems‚Äù.  I believe in the power of Reinforcement Learning, in that sense (1) it can autonomously come up with the solution given the goal (2) it interacts with and adapts to the changing world (3) it is the closest to how animals ‚Äòemerge‚Äô the intelligence as part of goal pursuit. To make RL successful, I deem there are plenty of challenges to solve such as sample efficiency, long-horizon control, and safe and autonomous learning. I believe that utilizing prior knowledge(e.g., common sense, offline data), and equipping the algorithms with long-term memorizing, hierarchical decision-making, and good abstraction can help to achieve my goal.
