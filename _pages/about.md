Hi there, my name is Haeone Lee. My goal is to develop intelligence that is helpful to humans, consisting of any form e.g., physical embodiment(robots), or software(android agent). I believe in the power of **Reinforcement Learning**, in that sense (1) it can reach the optimal performance (2) it interacts with and adapts to the changing world (3) it is the closest to how animals ‚Äòemerge‚Äô the intelligence as part of goal pursuit. To make RL successful, I deem there are plenty of challenges to solve such as efficient exploration, long-horizon control, and safe and autonomous learning. To this end, I am interested in utilizing prior knowledge(e.g., common sense, offline data), and equipping the algorithms with long-term memorizing, hierarchical decision-making, and good abstraction capabilities. For details, [**this**](https://rl-max.github.io/assets/pdf/Creating_Artificial_Intelligence_from_the_World.pdf) briefly surveys my thoughts.
