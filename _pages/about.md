Hi there, my name is Haeone Lee. I sometimes go by name 'Ian' too. I am interested in creating an embodied agent with great physical capability. Plus, I want to make AI more autonomous, which I interpret as making intelligence emerge. I believe this can be tackled by reinforcement learning as human learning and reward hypothesis suggest.
